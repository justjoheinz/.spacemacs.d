* .spacemacs.d

  Configuration files for [[http://spacemacs.org][spacemacs]]. Checkout the develop branch of
  spacemacs into =.emacs.d= and this repo into =.spacemacs.d=

* Layers

  Configured layers consist mainly of

  - org mode (including org roam)
  - common lisp (requires roswell)
  - scala

 and other helper layers.

** Import keyboard shortcuts

   =SPC a o j j= adds a journal entry for the day.
   =SPC a o r f= find roam files
   =SPC a o r i= insert roam link
* Org

  Org is configured to have its org files and org agenda files in =~/org=.
  Possibly sym link this with a drop box account.

* TODO Investigate locale

  GUI emacs and console emacs use different date formatting in journal mode. Investigate why.
