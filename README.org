* .spacemacs.d

  Configuration files for [[http://spacemacs.org][spacemacs]]. Checkout the develop branch of
  spacemacs into =.emacs.d= and this repo into =.spacemacs.d=

* Layers

  Configured layers consist mainly of

  - org mode (including org roam)
  - common lisp (requires roswell)
  - scala

 and other helper layers.

* Import keyboard shortcuts

  - =SPC a o r d t= :: adds a journal entry for the day
  - =SPC a o r f= :: find roam files
  - =SPC a o r i= :: insert roam link
  - =SPC a o o n= :: view org agenda agenda and todo items
  - =M-S-Ret= :: enter a new todo item

* Org

  Org is configured to have its org files and org agenda files in =~/org=.
  Possibly sym link this with a drop box account.

* TODOS
** TODO Investigate locale

   GUI emacs and console emacs use different date formatting in journal mode. Investigate why.
